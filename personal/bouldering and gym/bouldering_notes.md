TL;DR
### Before Climbing: Recruitment Pulls
- 20 mm edge; half crimp or chisel grip
- Building up to maximum effort over the course of 5-8 seconds; relax
- Focus on only pulling with fingers as much as possible (not deadlift-like)
- One set = pull on both hands
- First several sets = warm-up, after that, 5 - 8 working sets, ca. 3 minutes in between

### Shoulder warm-up (break between RP)
- External rotator muscles in our rotator cuff: "no moneys" with a resistance band
    - Don't let the band go slack; 8 - 12 reps, 3 sets total
- Stick (or rubber band) dislocates
    - 30 to 60 seconds, keep dynamic motion, 3 sets total
